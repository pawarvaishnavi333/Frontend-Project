        <h2>! Gynaba Tukaram !</h2>
        <p>Gatha Mandir/ temple is one of the biggest temple near Pune & PCMC. <br>
             There is a very big Statue of Sant Tukaram Maharaj at the Entrance of the temple.<br>
              Which itself is inspiring to all of us.<br>
              The main attraction of the Gatha temple is that all Gatha<br> (Abhang ) of Sant Tukaram Maharaj carved on walls of the temple.<br>
               More than 4000 Abhang Carved on walls.<br> You can read any one easily. It says that you need to read at least <br>
               3 Abhangs when you visited the temple. Also there are paintings of GOD on the walls surrounded by statue,<br> 
               which will remeber our Past Stories...<br>
              Temple is open from Morning 6 am to 10 pm. <br>
              There is a "Bhakta Nivas" near temple where you can stay & also at <br>
              " Annapurna " bhavan you can take Mahaprasad in between 12:30 to 2 pm.<br>
              The route to reach Gatha temple is already discussed in previous post. <br>
              To reach Gatha mandir you need to come from old pune mumbai road & the cross the Nigdi & after <br>
              3-4 km there is hoading at right hand side informing Sant Tukaram temple. <br>
              Then take a right turn from that Kaman to reach Gatha temple. It is around 25 km from Pune.<br>
              Gathan temple is situated on the bank of the Indrayani river. At the back side of the temple at Indrayani river<br>
               there is a place where gathas floated in river, don't forget to see that place. <br>
               Also old temple of the Sant Tukaram Maharaj renovated. It is also very good place where you will get happiness, <br>
               calm, cool environment.
